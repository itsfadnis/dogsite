# dogsite
> A playground where I like to experiment with new tech. It mostly shows you random dog images using the fantastic [dogapi](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Other useful things in the repo
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app setup with a custom express server
- Neat i18n setup with [next-i18next](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next)
- [Phrase (previously phrasapp)](https://phrase.com/) integration with English & French

More on the way hopefully..
